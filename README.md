## Motivation

As developers, many of us have attempted to compile Chromium from source, only to find the process extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive. **Syra** aims to address that challenge by leveraging the foundation provided by Wexondâ€™s project, now updated to support modern Node.js and Electron versions.

# Features

- **Syra Shield** - Browse the web without any ads and don't allow websites to track you. Thanks to the Syra Shield powered by [ghostery](https://github.com/ghostery/adblocker), websites can load even 8 times faster!
- **Chromium without Google services and low resources usage** - Since Syra uses Electron and wexond under the hood which is based on only several and the most important Chromium components, it's not bloated with redundant Google tracking services and others.
- **Fast and fluent UI** - The animations are really smooth and their timings are perfectly balanced.
- **Highly customizable new tab page** - Customize almost an every aspect of the new tab page!
- **Customizable browser UI** - Choose whether Syra should have compact or normal UI.
- **Tab groups** - Easily group tabs, so it's hard to get lost.
- **Scrollable tabs**
- **chrome extensions support** - install your favorite extensions from any chromium browser into Syra Browser instructions on setting this up can be found in [`docs/extensions`](docs/extensions.md)
