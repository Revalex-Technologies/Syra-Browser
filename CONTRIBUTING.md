# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Syra** (the “Project”). The Project is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL‑3.0)**. To keep things simple and compatible, all inbound contributions must be provided under **GPL‑3.0** as well.

> Plain‑English: you keep your copyright, you license your contribution to the Project under GPL‑3.0, and we keep the license/COPYRIGHT notices intact. No extra restrictions, no separate “patents” rider.

## 1) Inbound License Grant

You (the “Contributor”) retain ownership of your contribution(s) (“Contributions”). You grant the Project maintainers and all downstream recipients a **perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, irrevocable** license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your Contributions **under GPL‑3.0**.  
This is intended to align with GPLv3 §11 (patents) and does **not** impose any additional terms beyond GPL‑3.0.

**No additional restrictions.** You agree not to impose any further conditions (e.g., sales bans, donation bans, app‑store permission requirements, or field‑of‑use limits) beyond GPL‑3.0.

---

## 2) Originality, Rights, and Third‑Party Code

You represent that:
- Each Contribution is **your own original work**, **or** you have the rights to submit it under **GPL‑3.0**.  
- Any third‑party components you include are **GPL‑compatible** and properly attributed (e.g., MIT/BSD/Apache‑2.0 with NOTICEs preserved).  
- Your Contributions do **not** knowingly infringe any third‑party **copyrights, patents, trademarks**, or other rights.

If your employer or another entity owns your work, you confirm you have the necessary authority/permission to contribute under GPL‑3.0.

---

## 3) Scope Clarifications

- **Derivative changes to existing Project code.** If your Contribution modifies or extends existing Project files licensed under GPL‑3.0, your changes are a **derivative work** and must remain under **GPL‑3.0** in all forms and distributions.
- **New, standalone files.** If your Contribution is entirely new and not derived from existing Project GPL code, it is still licensed **as part of this Project under GPL‑3.0**. You may reuse your original work elsewhere or dual‑license **outside** this Project, provided you do not include any Project GPL‑covered code in that reuse.

---

## 4) Preservation of Notices

Do not remove or alter **copyright**, **license**, or **attribution** notices in the Project or in your Contributions. Add your own copyright notice for your changes where appropriate. Keep third‑party NOTICE files when required.

---

## 5) Trademarks & Branding

This CLA and the GPL license **do not grant trademark rights** in any Project names, logos, or brand identifiers. Any use of trademarks must follow applicable trademark law and any published guidelines.

---

## 6) Maintainership & Acceptance

Project maintainers may review, edit, or decline Contributions at their discretion. Submitting a Contribution does not obligate the Project to accept or distribute it.

---

## 7) Identification & Public Record

You consent to your GitHub handle (and, if you choose, your real name) being publicly associated with your Contributions via commit history, acknowledgements, changelogs, or attribution files.

---

## 8) Authority to Contribute

You confirm you are legally permitted to make the Contribution under **GPL‑3.0**. If contributing on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have the necessary authority.

---

## 9) How This Agreement Is Accepted

Submitting a pull request or otherwise contributing to the Project **constitutes your agreement** to this CLA.
